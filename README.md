Facebook

GitHub

-Resume: -keep it simple, have a paper copy and a digital copy as well and have it in your portfolio website.

Fist job is the toughest, you must get creative and aggressive

Do a lot of freelance work (like on craigslist), do small projects, try and get internship etc. to show that you have the experience and proof of work to employers. Who do you know? Find everyone who has a company, churches, non-profits etc. and if they don't have a website offer to build one even if it has to be free.

Find a community of web developers

during interview be direct to employers when they ask, "what do you do?" don't over exaggerate about yourself

know what category developer you are: 0-2 Years Experience = Junior Developer 2-4 Years Experience = Mid-level Developer 4-6 Years Experience = Senior Developer

The type of developers employers are looking for:

employees who take on the initiative to take on extra tasks, one who gives ideas, who shows that they are involved and interested at work
they want a employee who is not just a coder but a coder who has passion for what they do
a lot of employers want to know what you do after hours as well, do you take part in different developer groups, do you take on side projects etc.
What can I expect to get paid? Junior $25/hr or 50k Mid-level $35-45/hr or 70-90k Senior $55+/hr or 100k+

When taking the coding exam during the interview, add comments, employers want to see your thought process, how you plan on approaching and how you plan on finishing, and talk it out-loud as well, they are more concerned how you think then the actual results.

During interview ask calrifying questions, look into the companies values, try and see if your interest and there value come in together, look into what type of support system they mite have for you, will you be alone in a booth as the only developer for a small company or will you be working with a team who will be there to help you if you need it.

Be transparent to your employees, if you have another offer tell them but NEVER lie about a offer. when looking into a company make sure the location, the pay, and the culture fit your style.

you can learn how to best market yourself on Udemy.com

When asked by HR how much you are wanted to get paid, the best answer for a junior web developer is, "I am targeting market value/salary." Bring compensation to the table during salary negotiation.

and even if a company is offering a horrible pay, take it still first because you need a first job as a web developer and second, when companies pay horrible that means they expect a large turnover.

don't try to answer every question perfectly, employers want something real and not just a bunch of memorized lines.
